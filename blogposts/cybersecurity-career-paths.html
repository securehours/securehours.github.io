                        <h3>Cybersecurity Career Paths</h3>
                        <div class="post-info"><span>Jan 21, 2022</span></div>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">Cybersecurity is such a versatile field that there is no fixed career path. New cyber careers are being created every day, and people from various walks of life are transitioning into this field. In fact, cybersecurity sees one of the highest rates of career shifts in comparison to all other fields; that’s precisely what makes it so interdisciplinary. Besides, this lucrative field promises attractive offers even at entry-level positions. On the occasion of Cyber Career Day 2022, let’s look at some common career options in security.<br></p>
                        <h1 style="font-size: 23.184px;font-weight: bold;">Penetration Tester</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">This role requires the employee to test software and defense systems of an organisation by attempting to breach it. This is an organisation’s way of testing their software against real-world attacks without actually losing data in the event of a breach. A pentester, as commonly referred, will attack the target system and report any vulnerabilities to the organisation. A good pentester is up to date with new forms of threat intelligence and thinks from the perspective of an adversary. They must be proactive, innovative and form a holistic perspective of the company’s preparedness to respond to breaches. Pentesting comes under the offensive security category – the Red Team.<br></p>
                        <h1 style="font-size: 23.184px;font-weight: bold;">Incident Responder</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">While preventing breaches is important, it is imperative for an organisation to be able to respond to and recover from attacks that have already occurred. This is where incident responders come into the pictures. Their role is to reduce the capability of the attacker to damage the system further, ultimately eliminate the threat, and enable the breached system to recover from the breach rapidly. This position requires quick thinking, strong technical and observational skills, and adaptability.<br></p>
                        <h1 style="font-size: 23.184px;font-weight: bold;">Security Analyst</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">This term is fairly broad and often includes specialisations in a particular area. The role of an analyst is to understand the problem thoroughly and form a comprehensive solution to present to the organisation. For example, Digital Forensics Analysts examine compromised systems or digital media involved in an investigation for digital footprints of any sort. Malware Analysts look deep into threats to understand what flaw the malware exploited and what countermeasure are to be taken. Cloud Security Analysts helps organisations find their place securely in today’s multi-cloud environment. SOC (Security Operations Center) Analysts implement prevention, detection and response. GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) Analysts and Managers help companies effectively manage risks, reduce expenditure and meet compliance requirements. Analysts have to keep themselves updated with advancing technology as innovative methods of breaching are discovered every day.<br></p>
                        <h1 style="font-size: 23.184px;font-weight: bold;">Security Architect and Security Engineer</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">These experts protect an organisation’s most valuable asset – data. They design and implement network security protocols to balance prevention, detection and response in a holistic manner, protecting sensitive information from the endpoint all the way to the cloud. They also balance business and technical requirements of an organisation. Security Architects and Engineers come under the Blue Team category, associated with cyber defense. Innovation and adaptability are crucial qualities required to take up either of these posts.<br></p>
                        <h1 style="font-size: 23.184px;font-weight: bold;">Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">This is the topmost rung of the cyber career ladder. The CISO is the executive responsible for an organization’s information and data security. They possess an equal understanding of information security and business, and are looked up to as the ultimate influencers and coordinators. With a thorough knowledge of policy, global markets, legislation and operations, the CISO should be able to come up with creative solutions to fresh threats and implement strategic security planning to protect the organisation in the long run.<br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;"><br>Besides these cyber careers, there are so many more opportunities already present, and new jobs being created as we speak. Each cybersecurity enthusiast designs their own career structure as they move along their learning path, discovering their interests and strengths. This post was just to provide an idea of how diverse the careers are, help provide some clarity on what job your current interests align with and get you excited about cybersecurity as a profession. We hope this was indeed helpful.<br></p>
