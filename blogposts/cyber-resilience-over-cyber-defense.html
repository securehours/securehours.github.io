                        <h3>Cyber Resilience over Cyber Defense</h3>
                        <div class="post-info"><span>November 5, 2021</span></div>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">The cyberattacks on the US fuel pipeline and Canadian N.L. healthcare this year have proven yet again that no cyber defense system is immune to breaches. Organisations are working on building stronger defense systems, adding more screening layers and security patches. The major focus is on the prevention aspect of cybersecurity. However, it is imperative to strengthen the cyber resilience of the organization as well.<br><br>According to the NIST CSRC, Cyber resilience is “The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources.” (Cite: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cyber_resiliency">https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cyber_resiliency</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171r2">NIST SP 800-172</a> from <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v2">NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2</a>) Essentially, this means preparing for, responding to and recovering from cyberattacks while continuing to operate effectively. No matter how secure a defense system is, cyber breaches occur anytime, anywhere. Individuals will come up with innovative techniques to commit data breaches. If a security system is penetrated, and the organization is unable to handle the breach and eliminate the threat, then it is compromised for good. An organisation with a decent, ordinary defense system but strong cyber resilience is far more secure than one with an elaborate security system but no cyber resilience.<br><br>To build one’s cyber resilience, be it an organization or the common user, three simple steps are involved:<br><br>1. Isolation of data<br>2. Reduction of impact radius<br>3. Rapid recovery<br><br><br><strong>1. Isolation of Data</strong><br><br>A basic security measure for all digital users is to create backups of all their data, and <em>physically isolate it from the current device</em>. Making copies of data in the same device has virtually no benefit with regards to data protection. Isolation of the replicated data has twin benefits – besides protecting the copy from being hacked as well, it aids rapid recovery by avoiding the task of reproducing the data from scratch.<br><br><br><strong>2. Reduction of Impact Radius</strong><br><br>This requires a bit more agility. The moment one suspects any form of malware or breaching, the safest thing to do is cut off the application from the rest of the device, or device from the rest of the network, as the case may be. Taking a simple example, it very often happens that while visiting a website, in our attempt to click a certain button, an advertisement suddenly appears over it and gets clicked instead. Suppose such a case occurs, and a blank tab opens and an unknown file starts downloading. We shut the browser, disconnect from the internet immediately and restart the computer. If we have an antivirus software (which we always should), we run a threat scan once the system reboots. Why did we do this? Shutting the browser prevents any more tabs from opening, while disconnecting from the internet stops the file from downloading completely. Restarting the system kills all running operations. In this way, we reduce the impact radius of any possible breaches by blocking further system access.<br><br><br><strong>3. Rapid Recovery</strong><br><br>Just as we learn from experience, our devices and networks should do the same. Following the elimination of a possible threat, steps must be taken to strengthen the preparedness of the system to respond to similar threats in the future. This can be done by installing additional antivirus software or isolating systems in a network so that even if some devices are down, others can continue to function normally, preventing spread of any malware. In the digital age of today, an organization’s success largely depends on the IT infrastructure, and rapid recovery is essential to maintain smooth operation.<br><br><br>With the growing competitiveness and lack of patience in the world, time is of the essence. Cyber attacks aren’t reducing in number. Resilience is the key to staying ahead of the crowd. The more resilient a network or system is, the faster will be its response to breaches, and the more efficient its functioning will be. It’s time we all become a little more cyber resilient.<br><br></p>
