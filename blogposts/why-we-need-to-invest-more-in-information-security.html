                        <h3>Why we need to invest more in Information Security</h3>
                        <div class="post-info"><span>November 14, 2021</span></div>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;">Data is unequivocally the most important and powerful asset of an organisation. Its value surpasses that of any hardware or software one can name. Generally, it takes a significant period of time and massive financial investments to accumulate any kind of credible data. It is fairly common that a company attempts to get hold of the records of its competitors, because then it would possess the same data without having invested precious time and resources. Naturally, this would leave the competitor at a disadvantage. To defend this sensitive asset, information security is the way to go as it helps prevent unauthorized access to confidential information, thus ensuring business continuity.<br><br>Unfortunately, companies rarely invest in security technologies that protect the data. They perceive information security as ‘building barriers’ which add to operation expenses and make a network more cumbersome for employees to use. Some regard basic protection measures as unnecessary investments and choose not to implement them. In the absence of protective screening layers, any third party can waltz into the company network and steal all the information resources without leaving a trace. Organisations need to place information security at the top of the agenda in order to equip themselves to protect their data.<br><br>Generally, the ideal cybersecurity budget of a business should be at least ten to fifteen percent of the IT budget. This fraction of funds would be sufficient for a basic, decent security program which encrypts and protects the business’ records against data breaches and other cyber attacks. Studies show that around forty-five cyber attacks occur every second, and more than one thousand sensitive company files are unprotected, including credit card details and health records. Hence, this minimum precaution must be taken.<br><br>The major reason why people avoid cybersecurity is because they have formed incorrect notions about the field which dissuade them from investing in it. For example, some envision information security as a fortification of data by a firewall which isolates them from threats. Some have never had a data breach, so they do not feel the need to change anything. Others think of it as a finite solvable problem instead of an ongoing continuous one. A lot of people interpret it as an abstruse subject not worth getting into. This actually is also why governments and other influential organisations are not investing in promoting cybersecurity awareness. The lack of grants, scholarships, recognition and academic resources prevents research, development, practice and application in the security field. Attackers are getting smarter and more innovative, the time taken to perform an attack in reducing. It is vital that an appreciation for the cultural change and infinite nature of information security is fostered. This will help each individual will realise that information security is their responsibility, regardless of department or seniority.<br><br>Information security is the way of the future – there is no doubt about it. Every single device connected to the Internet is vulnerable and requires a strong defense system. The benefits of investing in an appropriate security plan outweigh the costs. It protects the ability of the organisation to function safely and normally. In the long run, it will absolutely save valuable time and resources.<br></p>
