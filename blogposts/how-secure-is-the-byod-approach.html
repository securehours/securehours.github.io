                        <h3>How secure is the BYOD approach?</h3>
                        <div class="post-info"><span>December 9, 2021</span></div>

                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;"><br>Adapting to the new normal of the pandemic included changes in our lifestyle and policies. Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies at the workplace saw a major transformation towards helping employees shift to remote work. While the new policies eased this shifting process, security took a hit because companies could no longer enforce their security policies on employee systems.<br><br>With the Company-Owned-Personally-Enabled (COPE) policies, there are restrictions on the amount of personal information that can be stored on these systems. All devices are connected to the company network – though this could lead to faster spread of data breaches, it enables efficient, uniform execution of security policies throughout the network. As compared to individuals, companies are more likely to use sophisticated, effective security tools to defend their systems.<br><br>BYOD, however, does not guarantee the same level of cybersecurity as COPE does. It leaves each employee responsible for the protection of their own data. Working from home usually means the use of personal devices to access corporate files. Personal devices house private information – the treasure that cyber criminals are after. Not everyone actually takes security measures such as running antivirus scans or disabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use; this increases the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, it has now become a common habit to attend to personal mails and social media notifications while doing official work. Malicious infiltration through the work page into the personal page or vice versa aids the spread of malware. And of course, home Wi-Fi networks are extremely easy to hack into. A home environment thus leaves the employees more vulnerable to cyber attacks.<br><br>The only way to overcome the insecurity of BYOD policies is to ensure the employees take necessary prevention and detection measures. This can be achieved through spreading awareness. Working from home brings a world of distractions, including family interruptions, social visitors, and household maintenance. This in turn can make individuals more careless about data protection. Reminding employees about the importance of a dedicated workspace, updated antivirus software, maintaining Zero Trust and backing up personal information can go miles in helping them take effective measures to strengthen their system security. Also, the company can provide remote tools such as security software which is not too intrusive, and multi-factor authentication with an inactivity timer.<br><br> In this way, BYOD can prove to be one of the most efficient work approaches which provides both luxuries to its employees: flexibility and security.<br></p>
