                        <h3>Cybersecurity Rundown 2021</h3>
                        <div class="post-info"><span>December 31, 2021</span></div>
                        <figure class="figure"></figure>
                        <p style="font-size: 16.4px;"><br>Throughout the past year, the security landscape has been bombarded with major attacks and data breaches to an unprecedented extent. The sophistication in each attack reached its peak through the misuse of emerging technologies. However, 2021 also brought with it a respectable increase in the cybersecurity awareness of the public, as proven by various surveys and adequate funding for Security Budgets. As we bid goodbye to this year, it’s time for Secure Hours’ Cybersecurity Rundown 2021 – and this is not your usual rundown. Some very skilled security students under the pseudonyms WeaveAche, Deuterium and Kārṣṇya very kindly agreed to join this discussion, and shared some brilliant perspectives.<br><br><br><strong>Q1. According to you what was the worst cyber attack of 2021 and why?</strong><br><br><strong>WeaveAche</strong>: Uh, it’s really hard to pick one. We did have a lot of high-profile cyber attacks this year. The SolarWinds attack, FaceBook data breach (*cough* which is a yearly trend by now *cough*) and Kaseya ransomware being some of them. But if I had to pick the worst one financially, I’d say the Twitch data dump. I mean, their entire code database was dumped. Had Twitch been a small business they’d have lost all their clients, users and gone out of business.<br><br><strong>Deuterium</strong>: Honestly, SolarWinds is a great contender (practically 2020 though) but given people have no clue so far, it should be it. Why is it the worst hack? Because it’s a zero-day supply chain attack; attackers monitored almost all fortune 500 companies for about a year and no one had the slightest clue. It’s essentially getting punished for being up to date with current patches.<br><br><br><strong>Q2. What is your take on the log4j vulnerability and how long do you think it will be around?</strong><br><br><strong>WeaveAche</strong>: It was a bit disappointing, for the lack of a better word. The technique used to exploit this vulnerability (JNDI injection) was known since 2016, yet the vulnerability in log4j remained unnoticed till now. Add to that the fact that two new vulnerabilities were discovered in log4j after the original Log4Shell vulnerability, in a single month. Nothing of this scale has happened since, like, Heartbleed or Shellshock in 2014. Thankfully, the collective response of the internet was really good and most of the affected applications, systems have been patched. So, the impact of it has definitely reduced by a lot. But not so surprisingly, not everyone will have patched it yet and it’ll probably stay in some systems, maybe even for decades.<br><br><strong>Deuterium</strong>: log4j is a usual CVE, everyone knows it’s a vulnerability. It will stay as long as people don’t patch on time (which could be, like, forever), but at majority of the places it will be patched within a month.<br><br><br><strong>Q3. One of the reasons there aren’t enough cybersecurity&nbsp;professionals is because people perceive the field as ‘tedious,&nbsp;uninteresting and generally difficult to learn’. What would you say to&nbsp;excite the readers about this field?</strong><br><br><strong>WeaveAche</strong>: Honestly, I think of this field as anything but uninteresting/boring. Granted it has a learning curve in the beginning, but that is natural since this field is heavily knowledge-dependent. You’ll pick up this knowledge eventually, once you get started.<br><br><strong>Deuterium</strong>: It is definitely tedious and difficult to learn and will always be as soon as technology evolves, and in my humble opinion, this same fact makes it super exciting. It is in fact less tedious as you would require to be an engineer of equivalent caliber. Making things is more tedious than breaking them. You write software, you write endless tests for it, you test it endlessly only to know that someone found a trivial break in your software. Breaking stuff is one time, making stuff is endless. What’s most exciting about cybersecurity is that it grants unimaginable power to individuals. Otherwise insignificant people can shake nations, governments, organizations. It is always as mysterious as a Sherlock Holmes novel and as potent as a nuclear weapon. The idea of writing a piece of software capable of breaking the world and writing software equivalently capable of preventing those breaks is infinitely exciting and interesting to me.<br><br><br><strong>Q4. Another myth buster: how would you respond to the claim “cybersecurity is all about hacking”?</strong><br><br><strong>WeaveAche</strong>: Yeah, this is a very common myth. Hacking (ethical) is just a subset of cyber security. If I had to explain it to someone, an ethical hacker is just entrusted with finding newer ways of a attacking a system. While in a broader sense, a cyber security analyst’s job is to find and resolve these issues in a system.<br><br><strong>Deuterium</strong>: Pass – police is all about crime.<br><br><strong>Kārṣṇya</strong>: I personally prefer to think that cybersecurity is the field where we get to understand systems from diverse domains. Moreover, the understanding is deep enough to find out if some system has an assumption which might not always hold true. When the system is configured such that its underlying assumptions are broken, the system either errors out or does not give the usual expected result. In layman terms, the system is “hacked.” By using the in-depth knowledge obtained, we can also reduce the number of assumptions a system makes to function. This makes the system resilient not only against malicious attacks but also strange user inputs. Thus, in my opinion, cybersecurity is not hacking but rather hacking is one of outcomes of studying cybersecurity.<br><br><br><strong>Q5. What do you think will be the next big thing after cloud security?</strong><br><br><strong>WeaveAche</strong>: In my opinion, the next big thing would be security in machine learning models. Since machine learning is relatively new, there is not much focus on security. This was true in the case of the internet too. When internet came around, everyone was busy exploring what all could be done with it. And in retrospect, some bad design decisions were made which still haunt us till this day. The research on attacking ML models has already started, but it is still at its early stages. We are at the stage of boom in machine learning research and deployment of these newer techniques. So, the consequences of not focusing on security can be devastating in the near future. One popular example is that of a self-driving car, they are driven by ML models. Imagine if someone could deceive the model by placing a maliciously crafted sign-board on the road.<br><br><strong>Deuterium</strong>: Everything can be made better. Cloud security itself is not very complicated and super-efficient given that defining malicious behaviour is extremely hard by itself. Actually, capable AI solutions, scalable verification models, reliable internet backbones, rights to privacy as the fundamental law everywhere would be indeed very interesting to see.<br><br><br><strong>Q6. What does cybersecurity look like in 2022?</strong><br><br><strong>WeaveAche</strong>: I have no idea! The beauty of this field is it is so unpredictable. You never know what new to expect. You really have to keep up with what is going on currently.<br><br><strong>Deuterium</strong>: Its almost similar to the question “how would 2022 music look like?” There will always be 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s and 20s music. There will be a lot of 2021 music and a lot of 2022 music. There will be great music which outlives generations and there will be music no one would ever notice. Let’s wait and see listen what artists have in their minds.<br><br><br>Indeed, we can only wait and watch. With that it’s a wrap! A massive thank you to WeaveAche, Deuterium and Kārṣṇya for their interesting views. Happy New Year to everyone, see you all in 2022 with many more exciting cybersecurity reads!<br><br></p>
